Game Concept: TileMaze is a puzzle game where you help a character move through mazes using special tiles with symbols. Your goal is to reach the exit while overcoming obstacles.

Game Mechanics:

    Maze Grid: The game takes place on a grid, like a big square with walls and paths.

    Tile Bag: You have a bag of tiles with symbols like arrows, keys, gates, and switches.

    Tile Placement: You can put tiles from your bag onto empty spots on the grid.

    Match Symbols: Tiles must be placed carefully to match symbols on nearby tiles. For example, if you put an arrow tile next to a wall, it might open up a path in that direction.

    Obstacles: The maze has locked gates and traps. You need specific tiles to get past them.

    Switches: Some tiles work as switches that turn things on or off in the maze, like gates or traps.

    Goal: You win by navigating through the maze using tiles, activating switches, and avoiding traps to reach the exit.

    Score: You earn points based on how few moves and tiles you use. Fewer moves and fewer tiles mean more points.

    Challenges: As you progress, the mazes get trickier, testing your puzzle-solving skills.

    Hints: If you get stuck, you can use hints or undo your last move.

    Levels: There are many levels, each with tougher mazes.

    Time: You might have a timer, so completing a level quickly can get you more points.

    Place tiles carefully to match symbols and solve puzzles.

    Some tiles you can only use once, but others you can pick up and use again.

    The game ends when you reach the exit or run out of moves.
